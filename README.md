## TODOs

- [ ] Change Config file '.json' to '.yaml'
- [ ] Change Debugging tool 'tensorboard' to 'mlflow'
- [ ] model code modularization

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.5 (3.6 recommended)
* PyTorch >= 0.4 (1.2 recommended)
* tqdm (Optional for `test.py`)
* tensorboard >= 1.14 (see [Tensorboard Visualization](#tensorboard-visualization))

## Features
* Clear folder structure which is suitable for many deep learning projects.
* Customizable command line options for more convenient parameter tuning.
* Checkpoint saving and resuming.
* Abstract base classes for faster development:
  * `BaseTrainer` handles checkpoint saving/resuming, training process logging, and more.
  * `BaseDataLoader` handles batch generation, data shuffling, and validation data splitting.
  * `BaseModel` provides basic model summary.

## Usage

### Using config files
Modify the configurations in `.json` config files, then run:

  ```
  python train.py --config config.json
  ```

### Resuming from checkpoints
You can resume from a previously saved checkpoint by:

  ```
  python train.py --resume path/to/checkpoint
  ```

### Using Multiple GPU
You can enable multi-GPU training by setting `n_gpu` argument of the config file to larger number.
If configured to use smaller number of gpu than available, first n devices will be used by default.
Specify indices of available GPUs by cuda environmental variable.
  ```
  python train.py --device 2,3 -c config.json
  ```
  This is equivalent to
  ```
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3 python train.py -c config.py
  ```
